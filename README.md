# tic-tac-toe

Play a game of tic-tac-toe against a friend or 3 different AI's with difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard!

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/

<h2>Reflection</h2>

Completing this project has taught me:

  - How to use IIFE's and modular pattern.
  - How to use event delegation.
  - How easily codebases can become difficult to manage!

In future projects I'll focus more on planning the overall structure of my code before I start coding to improve its clarity.
